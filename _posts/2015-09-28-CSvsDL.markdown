Compressive sensing vs deep learning
------------

“In a way, residency is training the neural network of physicians”
       -- Stanford Assistant Professor of Ophthalmology Richard Chang

Recent trends in computational image analysis include compressive sensing (a topic of my thesis) and extremely popular deep learning (DL) approaches. The discussion here targets the “unreasonable effectiveness” (to misquote [Andrej Karpathy][karpathyBlog]) of deep neural networks (DNN) in practical, physician-centric approach.  A brief introduction is given for compressive sensing (CS), parallels are drawn between CS and DL, and a commentary with annotated figures presented on why CS has not seen more uptake in image analysis as opposed to DL where application has been rapid (e.g. [EyePACS + EyeNucs Retinopathy diagnosis][eyeNucs] using Ben Graham’s winning [DL algorithm][benKaggle]).  The argument hinges on human perception of texture that in a way DL perceives in a familiar fashion to physicians.

Hi, I’m Leo, the Deep Learning Community Manager at NVIDIA NALA.  Take with a grain of salt my latest thoughts on DL and updates on events.  

I'm just getting started on Jekyll.  I'm looking at [Jekyll's docs][jekyll], [GitHub repo][jekyll-gh], and [GitHub docs][jekyll-help].  I followed Barry Clark's [guide][jekyllGitPages] for initial setup.
