NVIDIA continues to priortize engaging with the community at the finest level, this week sponsoring the [StartupML conference][startupML]. Deep learning and enterprise GPU use grows in importance for financial and medical startups.  CEO of medical startup Enlitic kicked off with a talk introducing deep learning.

Yelp graciously hosted the event at their offices in downtown San Francisco.  We had shipped our [DIGITS DevBox][devbox] ahead of time, and quickly got it setup.  The DevBox drew great reactions, marveling at the power of 4 Titan X blasting away at a deep learning training.  Not to mention, many enthusiasts appreciate SLI taken to the max.

Boris Ginsburg, Chief Deep Learning Scientist, gave a great presentation on tips and tricks for DL training.  In the second part, he covered RNNs and LSTMs that are particularly relevant for time series data.

We wrapped up the event by raffling away a Titan X and the [Jetson TK1 developer board][TK1].  While the Titan X has the higher MSRP, the TK1 is everything you need to build a HTPC and more.  It's fully capable of running a kick-ass Linux stack, see [JetPack][jetpack] for more details.

*Congratulations to our raffle winners, lucky, lucky!* 

Deep learning is the the heart of the revolution for many industries, this week focusing on startup and time series applications.
