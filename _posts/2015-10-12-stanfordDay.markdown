Last week, NVIDIA ran it's annual accelerated computing event at Stanford with this year's theme of End-to-End Analytics.  The event was held at the beautiful Jen-Hsun Huang Engineering Center right on the Engineering Quad.  The event was over-subscribed and the morning session featuring speakers such as NVIDIA Chief Architect of Automotive Urs Müller, Patrick Ehlen of Loop AI, Andrej Karpathy of Stanford CS, Cyprien Noel of [Yahoo][yahooSpark], and NVIDIA Chief DL Scientist Boris Ginsburg

*Talk by NVIDIA Chief Architect of Automotive Urs Müller was packed*

A highlight of the event was the demonstrations session, where we showed DIGITS 2 on the DevBox, a data munging and DL tool Lablr, and Jason Yosinski's [Deep Visualization Toolbox][deepViz].  We got to use the HANA Immersive Visualization Environment [(HIVE)][HIVE], measuring an impressive 10ft by 24ft 13440x5400 resolution. The ground floor on the iCME was packed (tip: the Forbes Family Cafe on the first floor is a great place to grab a bite).

*A session in the HANA Immersive Visualization Environment is a great way to explore structure in your dataset*

It turns out we weren't the only ones on campus.  Tesla and Elon Musk had a significant presence on campus as part of the Stanford [Future Fest][ff].  They had a pretty nice booth setup.  What a day!
