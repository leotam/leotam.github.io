Last week, a free, invitation-only event hit my radar courtesy of my counterpart in EMEA, the esteemable [Alison Lowndes][AlisonTwitter]. The [360Fashion Awards][360fashion] brought together technology and wearables with deep learning, AI, and startups putting them into practice.  After checking out a [deeplearning4j workshop][dl4j], I hopped over to the Metreon for the IBM event.

The venue was certainly excellent, the 4th floor of the Metreon, normally reserved for functions.  The Metreon situated near the Moscone Center (home to many a tech conference) is a typical spot to watch a film.

In the spirit of the visual aspect of the event, here are a few quick images and reactions

*Social response billboard.  AI and deep learning reaching into all corners of our lives.* 

IBM continues it's forward-looking trend approach.  My contacts at IBM point out another reach into daily lives [Chef Watson][chefWatson], what a world!
