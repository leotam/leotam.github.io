Recently, a pharma VC asked what theses emerged from our **Thesis Search** agentic AI.  
After some discussion, he described our criteria as *idiosyncratic*.

While somewhat true, as anyone (everyone) who has suffered in public markets can attest, investing theses must be **bullet‑proof**.

Success in public markets demands:

* Analysis that precedes broad market recognition  
* A clear catalyst that unlocks value  

A bullet‑proof thesis anchors on **unstoppable forces** or **immovable objects**—conditions inevitable in their mission, function, and execution.  

How do we originate such theses?

Originating a good thesis is a thunderbolt to the brain.  
DeepSeek R1—and models like OpenAI’s o1—exhibit *aha* or *eureka* moments.  
These moments are core to human cognition, from Archimedes in his bath to Newton under his apple tree.

It is easy to dismiss this as qualitative. It is deeper.  
Eureka moments are a fundamental feature of higher intelligence.

In split‑brain studies, physiology Nobel laureate Roger Sperry showed the brain operates in two modes associated with the left and right hemispheres.  

* **Left hemisphere** — analytical, language synthesis and understanding  
* **Right hemisphere** — visual cognition and artistic perception  

When the corpus callosum is severed, the hemispheres act like two individuals.  
The left brain cannot verbalize what the right brain perceives through the left eye.

Yet right‑brain perception is critical: seeing things *as they really are*.  
Language, a symbolic activity, can devolve into Plato’s cave shadows.  
True insight arises when left‑brain symbolism and right‑brain perception align.

Activities that link both hemispheres—music performance, for example, are common among great thinkers.  

Einstein adored his violin.  

MSU researchers found Nobel laureates are **2.85 ×** more likely than average scientists to pursue artistic pastimes.  
Northwestern and UNC teams discovered cross‑hemispheric prefrontal activity intensifies with task difficulty.

A eureka moment is the electrifying alignment of these two modes.

This aspect of LLMs is scarcely studied.  
Early Microsoft research employs left/right‑brain analogues for agentic evaluation and action—*stepping back to view data as it is*. 
With agentic **Thesis Search**, R1 steps back, examines reality, and yields eureka moments.

**What investing theses should we produce?**  
Bullet‑proof ones—those that require seeing reality clearly and weaving higher symbolic structures into predictions **ahead of market discovery**.  

This core of human intelligence remains un‑programmed explicitly in LLMs, even as emergent behaviors appear.
