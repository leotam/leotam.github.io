Hi, Iâ€™m Leo, the Deep Learning Community Manager at NVIDIA NALA.  Take with a grain of salt my latest thoughts on DL and updates on events.  

I'm just getting started on Jekyll.  I'm looking at [Jekyll's docs][jekyll], [GitHub repo][jekyll-gh], and [GitHub docs][jekyll-help].  I followed Barry Clark's [guide][jekyllGitPages] for initial setup.
