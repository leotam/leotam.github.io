Hi, I’m Leo, the Deep Learning Community Manager at NVIDIA NALA.  Take with a grain of salt my latest thoughts on DL and updates on events.  

I'm just getting started on Jekyll.  I'm looking at [Jekyll docs][jekyll] for more info on how to get the most out of Jekyll. Here's [Jekyll’s GitHub repo][jekyll-gh] and [Jekyll’s dedicated Help repository][jekyll-help].  I followed Barry Clark's [guide][jekyllGitPages]
