## Economic Moats for the Next Century or Artificial Intelligence is More Profound than Electricity

The weekend heralds the release of Berkshire Hathaway’s [annual shareholder letter](http://www.berkshirehathaway.com/letters/2018ltr.pdf?mod=article_inline), marking the 59th year that Warren Buffett overtook the enterprise out of spite (1).  Buffett’s investment strategies have revolved around identifying companies with strong core businesses that are protected by economic moats – factors that help protect a company’s market position from its rivals. While Buffett’s activities have marked a master class in sound company valuation and investing, he admittedly shies away from the technology sector, admitting it often lies outside his “circle of competence.”  No doubt, he would ascribe artificial intelligence and machine learning as beyond the scope of his investment philosophy, however we presently observe how his principles can through straightforward extension apply to AI and its importance in modern day enterprise.  Namely, AI and ML has two primary economic effects, widening economic moats of sufficiently agile businesses, and ushering the greatest epoch of wealth transfer in modern history.

Before we describe how AI forms one of the most powerful economic moats through a scalable distillation of performance, a review of economic moats must be considered.  The economic moat example is best described through Charlie Munger’s exposition on Coca-Cola, the company Buffett has “no desire to go to war with” (2). Munger’s canonical example of Coca-cola centralizes on these points:

1. Trade secret: The formula isn’t patented and therefore has the protection of a trade secret
2. Quality Brand: Even if the formula could be determined, Coca-Cola globally offers a consistent experience from a remote island to the farthest desert 
3. Scale: It is at scale such that even if a rising competitor sought inroads vs loss leaders, it’d barely move the needle before said competitor could be acquired or innovation substantially co-opted.

Such factors combine such effect that Buffett states, "If you gave me $100 billion and said, 'Take away the soft drink leadership of Coca-Cola in the world,' I'd give it back to you and say it can't be done (3)". 
Whereas the Coca-Cola economic moat centers around a physical product, AI and ML operates on the great engine of the modern economy, knowledge work and the specialized worker.

We can now map the AI and ML processes that create economic moats around knowledge products. Namely:
1. Trade secrets through AI architectures: even if more general techniques in deep learning (a subset of machine learning) are openly shared, the specific implementations and optimizations used by different companies are proprietary, allowing companies who perform well to maintain their advantages (4,5)
2. Quality through quantum leap in performance: modern AI systems have left traditional systems in the dust. AI methods have driven advances that traditionalists previously thought were possible only with decades of work (6)

3. Scale: As AI pioneers have discovered, the more users and data, the better such systems become.  Competitors face vast worker hours to create vital data lakes that enable AI systems, not to mention physical datacenter infrastructure (7) 

As an AI leader, we evaluate how Alphabet and its holdings are pursuing an AI first strategy, or why its CEO has said, “AI is more profound than... fire, electricity” (8). Google has obvious tremendous innovation in AI architectures, for instance having more publications than any other company at the leading deep learning conference NeurIPS, and implementing in products, for example having the leading English speech to text implementation (allegedly 300 world-class engineers engaged in its optimization). Google’s systems are found across leaderboards in disparate applications.  They embrace scale (9).  It’s evident from its wide and deep AI moat, Google will continue to deliver above average economic premiums.

Though the conditions for AI success in enterprise are complex, solutions hinge on laser focussed determination to create a business with an economic moat. As in the example of Coca-Cola, the rewards for successful execution are evident – decades of return and economic premiums.  Buffett claims technology is outside his circle of competence, but his mastery of economic moats means investors from his school will not be left far behind.  In future articles, the details of economic moats in AI will be revealed.
