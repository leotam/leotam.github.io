# BACKGROUND 
Cities and corporations, large and small, are reassessing their long- and short-term growth as the world seeks to combat a global pandemic. For communities to prosper and survive, there is a considerable focus on the sociological impact of climate change. The long-term perspective has made it more important than ever to look beyond and establish a sustainable future, one in which cities and corporations collaborate to assess, restore, and protect the environment. The Carbon Disclosure Project (CDP), a non-profit organization, is trying to hasten an economic transformation that benefits both people and the environment in the long run. Investors, enterprises, cities, governments, and regions can use CDP's worldwide disclosure system to manage their environmental impacts on climate change, water security, and deforestation. The disclosure system keeps track of the thousands of corporations, cities, states, and regions that submit data as part of its annual reporting process and assigns ratings to companies and localities based on their progress toward environmental leadership. To monitor and manage their risks and opportunities, the world's economy looks to CDP as the gold standard of environmental reporting, with the richest and most complete dataset on business and city action. 

# INTRODUCTION
With a growing national recognition of climate change's role in exacerbating the conditions that have resulted in earlier and longer seasons of destruction, now is the time to act and try new approaches.  We at Amicus AI Investments, build on the tremendous body of work at the CDP â€“ Unlocking Climate Solutions Analytics Challenge (https://www.kaggle.com/c/cdp-unlocking-climate-solutions), in particular adapting the work from @mannmann2 and @rebeccaverghese (https://www.kaggle.com/mannmann2/kpis-for-measuring-climate-action-and-inequality) to center on corporate performance and what can be achieved with responsible business.  We open-source our code in a readable Jupyter Notebook format.

# OUR ANALYSIS 
More and more companies are going towards practices that are more environmentally and socially forward. As part of our research, we are looking for such companies that look to advance their financial benefits by using different ESG metrics. To find these companies we had to drop some of the initial metrics used on the Kaggle analysis. We found some of them not as useful. On top of that we optimized the few metrics we decided to use. To make them more efficient in terms of what we are looking for, we included securities and financial metrics data.
