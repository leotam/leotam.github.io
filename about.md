I'm Leonard, currently at NVIDIA.  I earned my Ph.D. from Yale University working on a method (compressive sensing) to exceed Nyquist sampling limits in MRI given prior information ([my thesis][nlgthesis] had an interesting mix of hardware, signal analysis, and machine learning).  In my spare time, I enjoy SCUBA diving and serve as [the All-Ivy Chair][ivychair] for the Brown Club of SV.  Here's a link to my [Google Scholar profile][scholar].
