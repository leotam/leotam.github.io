I'm Leonard, currently at NVIDIA.  My training is originally in mathematics and physics.  The two most beautiful things I've studied are the physics of ATP synthase and general relativity.

I earned my Ph.D. from Yale University using nonlinear magnetic gradient fields to exceed Nyquist sampling limits in magnetic resonance imaging ([my thesis][nlgthesis] had an interesting mix of hardware, mathematics, and physics).  

In my spare time, I enjoy SCUBA diving and cycling.  Here's a link to my [Google Scholar profile][scholar].
