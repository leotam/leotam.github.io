I'm Leo, the Deep Learning Community Manager at NVIDIA North and Latin America.  I earned my Ph.D. from Yale University working on a method (compressive sensing) to exceed Nyquist sampling limits in MRI given prior information.  In my spare time, I enjoy SCUBA diving as a PADI advanced certified diver.  Here's a link to my [Google Scholar profile][scholar], which will become increasingly dated the longer residence in industry.
